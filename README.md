# Password-Generator
For this challenge, I was asked to create a random password generator using a series of window prompts/alerts/confirms to obtain user selections for the password length as well as the character types to be included.  The final code contains arrays to store the character types available and those that were distilled after the user has made their selections.  My fully commented script file delineates the different methods employed to make this random password generator functional.

The screenshots below show the different window prompts/alerts/confirms.  The last image shows the password generator after the full generate password function has been run and the random password has been written to the generated password text area.
